    <p>
        She's pretty. But she's covered with scars. Scars to her beautiful. The tattoo is a symbol of that. Her life is full of ups and downs that sometimes come with no warning. She loves to be by herself. Too scared to go outside because of the things people say about her behind her back. But she'll grow with time. Come out of her shell. Slowly by slowly those words will fade away. And she'll be back on her two feet. Able to stand tall again. She's much more than she thinks. When she'll finally realize her power, be sure to remind her not to let that get to her head. Three things she has to hold on to.Faith. Hope. And Love. The greattest of these being Love.
